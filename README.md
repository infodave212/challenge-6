This challege or project is all about searching for weather condition in different cities accross the globe. I wanted to make the searches nice so i made the background color sky blue, and in order to be able to see the city in question visibly, I made it in italics. And down the very bottom I have the search history in italics. https://infodave212.github.io/challenge-6/
